    <h1>Mancakes</h1>

    <p>Sweet/savory hybrids can be tricky sometimes but I think this worked beautifully.</p>
    <p>We are talking about bacon, cheese, and onions after all, so it wasn't that big of a shock. The way the chipotle-spiced maple syrup brought everything together was a risk well rewarded.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces bacon, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup thinly sliced green onions</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3/4 cup cornmeal</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 1/3 cups milk</li>
        <li>2 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese, grated</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup warm maply syrup, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon chipotle chile powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vegetble oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes; remove from heat. Stir green onions into bacon and saute in hot fat until slightly softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer bacon mixture to a strainer to drain, retaining drippings.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper together in a large bowl. Add drained bacon mixture, milk, Cheddar cheese, eggs, melted butter, and sugar to flour mixture; whisk until batter is smooth. Let batter rest for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine maple syrup and chipotle chile powder together in a small bowl; whisk until chile powder is completely dissolved.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 teaspoon bacon drippings, 1 teaspoon oil, and 1 teaspoon butter on a griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by 1/4-cupful onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter. Transfer pancakes to plate and top with maple syrup.</li>
